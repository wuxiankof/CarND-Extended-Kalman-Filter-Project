    "- You'll need to initialize the state vector with the first sensor measurement.\n",
    "- Although radar gives velocity data in the form of the range rate $\\dot{\\rho}$, a radar measurement does not contain enough information to determine the state variable velocities $v_x$ and $v_y$. You can, however, use the radar measurements $\\rho$ and $\\phi$ to initialize the state variable locations $p_x$ and $p_y$.\n",

    "For lidar measurements, the error equation is y = z - H * x'. For radar measurements, the functions that map the x vector [px, py, vx, vy] to polar coordinates are non-linear. Instead of using H to calculate y = z - H * x', for radar measurements you'll have to use the equations that map from cartesian to polar coordinates: y = z - h(x').\n",

    "\n",
    "In C++, atan2() returns values between -pi and pi. When calculating phi in y = z - h(x) for radar measurements, the resulting angle phi in the y vector should be adjusted so that it is between -pi and pi. The Kalman filter is expecting small angle values between the range -pi and pi. HINT: when working in radians, you can add $2\\pi$ or subtract $2\\pi$ until the angle is within the desired range.\n",
