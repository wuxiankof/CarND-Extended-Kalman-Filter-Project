    "Now that you have learned how the extended Kalman filter works, you are going to implement the extended Kalman filter in C++. We are providing `simulated lidar and radar measurements detecting a bicycle that travels around your vehicle`. You will use a Kalman filter, lidar measurements and radar measurements to track the bicycle's position and velocity.\n",
